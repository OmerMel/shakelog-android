# Welcome to ShakeLog 🐞

**ShakeLog** is a comprehensive ecosystem for reporting and managing mobile application bugs directly from the field. By combining sensor detection, cloud storage, and a robust management portal, it bridges the gap between QA testers and developers.

## 🚀 The Ecosystem

ShakeLog consists of three main components:

1.  📱 [**Android SDK**](change)**:** Used by mobile developers to integrate "Shake-to-Report" functionality.

2.  ⚙️ [**Backend Server**](change)**:** The central brain handling authentication, data ingestion, and persistence.

3.  💻 [**Web Dashboard**](change)**:** A visual interface for teams to view, filter, and resolve bugs.


## 🏗 Architecture Overview

The system follows a modern client-server architecture backed by cloud storage.
